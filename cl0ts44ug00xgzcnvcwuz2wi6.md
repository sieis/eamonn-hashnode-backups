## Sacred Geometry with Adobe Illustrator

## The Joy of Drawing ‚úçÔ∏è

I love drawing; I'm just not very good at freehand drawing. As a kid, I had a knack for drawing geometric designs with pen, paper and a protractor. Sometimes a compass would join in the fun, but typically I just needed a bunch of straight lines and something to measure angles. 

### (Video walkthrough of the whole project at the bottom of this post)... üëá

I lost myself for hours drawing these things, and I absolutely had a blast. My Nana and Granddaddy commissioned me for pieces that they hung in their houses, and it gave me great joy to see them - my little pieces of art - when I would visit.

When my Granddaddy passed a few years ago, Mom gave me back the piece that I most recently drew for him back in 2014 when I, on a whim, decided to venture back into pen and ink for a moment. [pic below]

## Adobe Illustrator üñåÔ∏è

Having used Illustrator for several years now, I can't believe it's taken me this long to spin up some of my old passions in digital form.

As we all know, YouTube is a treasure trove for how-to tutorials, and I dove in to some Illustrator geometry wormholes before emerging with a few new tools.

Most of my experience in Illustrator has been in logo and advertising editing. This was the first full-fledged project that I set out to build from the ground up.

The pen and blend tools proved invaluable resources. The pen got me started when I wanted specific shapes drawn in the same manner I used to draw them by hand.

But then, the blend tool to build upon that even further.

By creating two lines and then blending by a specified number of steps between them, I can then manipulate the position of the original lines to produce the same hand drawn curved effect that mesmerized me as a child.

## Productized Designs üè¶

Using shape tools and listening to [NIN Ghosts](https://youtu.be/EojUUSNjhRg) and [freeCodeCamp's Code Radio](https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/) resulted in a lot of neat combinations, and ultimately the full collection of wallpapers that I [released as a pack](https://eamonn.gumroad.com/l/sacred-geometry) on Gumroad.

I've admired [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) for the past several years, and used the pandemic times to supplement my day job with a coding skill set. All the while, I've been wanting to spin up a side gig or business. I've resolved to build projects and products this year that can be monetized.

Maybe I make some money, maybe not. Already, the two products ([FREE Google Sheets Finance Tracker](https://eamonn.gumroad.com/l/personalfinance) and [Sacred Geometry](https://eamonn.gumroad.com/l/sacred-geometry)) and the one hackathon web app ([Infinite Memory](https://infinite-memory.netlify.app/)) have been of more benefit to me than some of the myriad tutorials I have endured over the past couple years.

Taking advantage of the learning process by writing about it here and documenting it where possible on video has been a further means by which I've solidified some of these new skills. 

## Building is Fun ü§ó

At the end of the day, though, I just like building stuff. It's fun. I want to be able to continue doing that in a way that provides value for more than just myself. I hope to continue building in public and documenting the journey. 

Thanks for following along!
