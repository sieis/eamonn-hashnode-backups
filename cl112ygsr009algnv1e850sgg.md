## Hashnode Auto-Backup Posts on Github

## 0. Hashnode Docs

@Hashnode is awesome! [Here is the official documentation for auto-backups](https://support.hashnode.com/docs/github-backup). But, I was so excited when I saw this feature, I wanted to highlight it myself as well. There are a couple small items that have been updated since the support article was published too. Info below in #2 ðŸ‘‡

I realized that auto-backup to GitHub was a thing while reading a [comparison of Hashnode and Dev.to](https://hashnode.com/vs/devto?source=hashnode-footer). They're both wonderful platforms, and the linked comparison was from Hashnode, so it's bent toward itself. 

## 1. New Repository

Create a new repository over on GitHub.

Throw down a quick `README.md` for good taste. **Because you're awesome**. And you want a link to your live site for the 1 person per year that will find you through GitHub.

## 2. Go to Your Blog Dashboard. 

There's a button straight to your **dashboard** under your profile pic. You can also click your **profile pic** for a dropdown menu. (The support docs are not yet update to reflect this, and I may [contribute](https://github.com/Hashnode/support/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) this fix unless you beat me to it!)

## 3. Select Backup Option from Sidebar

This pops up a window with some of your last operations, and in my case a lovely **FAILED **message across from each one.ðŸ˜… Don't worry, that's normal...next you need to actually install the Hashnode GitHub App so it can **not fail**.

## 4. Install & Authorize on ONE REPOSITORY

It will default to all repositories. Don't install on all your repositories. **Just select the one you created for your blog posts.**

## 5. Re-Save Previous Articles

You will be redirected back to your Hashnode Blog Dashboard after the app is installed on your repository. 

However, any previously published articles do not appear to be pushed to the backup repository. Only those going forward...

So, if you want those previously published ones to be backed up too, you'll need to **edit them** and re-save. You don't even have to make a change. Simply clicking Edit and then Save Post will trigger it to update in GitHub.
