Profile's are kind of a hot mess on LinkedIn imo right now. I converted mine to [Creator Mode](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a522537/linkedin-creator-mode?lang=en) last year, which you can do in the Resources section of your profile. This is supposed to help with discovery, highlighting content on your profile, and gives you access to "creator analytics".

Honestly, I'm using Hashnode for most of my content and making posts on LinkedIn sometimes now, but it's probably good to have the creator mode on, regardless...since, you know, we're creators. üòä

At any rate, click the Add profile section button under your title.

This brings up a host of options. Under Additional, you'll find **projects**. Give it a click and add your great work!

Fill out the details and you're good to go.

## Is it Worth It?

There are so many sections on LinkedIn, I hesitated to add another one to my profile. Add to this the fact that for some reason, there is not a way to rearrange the sections. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You can edit what sections are visible, but they are ordered according to LinkedIn. Seems dumb.

I may alter my profile further to remove some things like Honors & awards (mainly stuff from my college years). I think it's worth having projects, though, and I'll be sprucing that section up more over the course of this week.
