## Solution

Stop sweating a project resume. [This tool](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com) automatically organizes your GitHub projects into a tight, shareable PDF.

## Problem

Why use this? Resumes are terrible for everyone, and a pain to write. This will not replace a comprehensive resume, but it could be used to quickly generate a project-based list of your body of work on GitHub to easily share with a hiring manager before interviewing.

## How to Use

I came across this from a post on LinkedIn yesterday, and was impressed at the simplicity and genius of the project.

1. Star the [repository](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)
2. Your resume will be viewable at: `https://resume.github.io/?yourusername`

That's it. It took [mine](https://resume.github.io/?sieis) a few minutes to become available after starring.

## Not Perfect

Of course, this isn't perfect. There's zero control over how it looks and what is listed. But it's not supposed to replace a well documented, concise resume. This is fantastic for organizing your otherwise chaotic GitHub projects.

## Hope that's helpful ðŸ‘‹

I thought this was very cool, and I hope you find use for it. Share it with others!
